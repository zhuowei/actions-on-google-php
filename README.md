Prototyping a Google Assistant action in PHP.

Currently just repeats the user's words back.

actionlib.php provides helper methods to help you make your own Action in
php: currently it supports getting the raw input and asking the user for
a response.

actionlib.php tries to replicate the ActionsSdkAssistant methods from the
Node.js SDK: please let me know if there's anything I should change to make it more PHP-like.
